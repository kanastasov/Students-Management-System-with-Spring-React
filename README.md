Project Title: Student Management System
Project Description:
The Student Management System is a robust web application designed to streamline and automate the management of student data. Built using modern web development technologies, this system demonstrates the implementation of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture while adhering to best practices in software design and development.

Technologies Used
Backend Framework: Spring Boot
Frontend Framework: React.js
Database: PostgreSQL (PSQL)
ORM: Hibernate
Architectural Pattern: MVC with Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
Key Features
Student Management:

Add, update, delete, and retrieve student details such as name, age, grade, contact information, and enrollment status.
Validation for data integrity (e.g., unique email addresses and required fields).
Course Enrollment:

Manage courses, including adding, modifying, and deleting courses.
Enroll students in courses and track enrollment status.
Search and Filters:

Search for students and courses using various criteria.
Filter records based on attributes such as grade level or enrollment status.
Authentication and Authorization:

User authentication with role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Teacher, Student).
Secure API endpoints with Spring Security and JWT tokens.
Responsive Design:

A user-friendly interface designed with React.js to ensure compatibility across devices and browsers.
RESTful API integration with the backend for seamless data operations.
Reporting:

Generate reports on student performance, attendance, and enrollment trends.
Export data to CSV or PDF formats.
Architecture and Design
Model Layer:

Built using Hibernate, representing the database schema with clean and efficient entity mappings.
DTOs are used to transfer data between layers, ensuring decoupling and reducing redundant data exposure.
Controller Layer:

RESTful APIs developed with Spring Boot to handle HTTP requests.
Controllers handle business logic and delegate data processing to the service layer.
View Layer:

A React.js frontend consumes the APIs and provides a dynamic, interactive user interface.
Components are structured for modularity and maintainability.
Database Design
PostgreSQL (PSQL):
Efficient schema design with normalized tables for entities such as Students, Courses, Enrollments, and Users.
Relationships between entities are handled with foreign keys and appropriate constraints.
Development Practices
MVC Architecture: Ensures clear separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
DTO Layer: Implements a lightweight mechanism for transferring data between the client and the server, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
Version Control: Managed through Git to track changes and collaborate effectively.
Testing:
Unit testing for backend services and repositories.
Integration testing for API endpoints.
End-to-end testing for the React frontend.
Outcome
The Student Management System showcases the implementation of a full-stack web application using Spring Boot and React while maintaining clean and scalable code. It is an excellent demonstration of how modern web development technologies and practices can be applied to solve real-world problems in an educational context.
